            <p>We are FIRST Robotics Competition team 122. Our team's motto is "Inspire at all costs."

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
            <p>By reaching out to different schools across the peninsula, we have nearly doubled our previous membership, with 35 members and 10 mentors this year. Currently, the NASA Knights service students from 8 different public and private high schools across the peninsula, with these students in programs like the New Horizons Career and Technical Education, Governor’s School for Science and Technology, and the International Baccalaureate programme. Over half of our team consists of first years: students who have recently discovered a passion for robotics and desire to learn more about it. A third of our team is female, but these girls are definitely not damsels in distress.  Most of them work in fabrication, half of the programming subgroup is female and our animation subgroup is entirely female. Some dedicated team members even drive as far as nearly and hour from their home schools to attend meetings. Our team is a community that fosters communication, cooperation, as well as skills that students can apply to many aspects of their lives.</p>
