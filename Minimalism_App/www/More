Take a look around: everyone is “busy.” We’re doing more than we’ve ever done, attempting to fill every interstitial zone with more work. Every downtown scene is the same: heads tilted downward, faces lost in glowing screens, technology turning people into zombies. We live in a busy world, one in which our value is often measured in productivity, efficiency, work rate, output, yield, GTD, the rat race. We are inundated with meetings and spreadsheets and status updates and rush-hour traffic and tweets and conference calls and travel time and text messages and reports and voicemails and multitasking and all the trappings of a busy life. Go, go, go. Busy, busy, busy. Americans are working more hours than ever, but we are actually earning less. Busy has become the new norm. If you’re not busy, especially in today’s workplace, you’re often thought of as lazy, unproductive, inefficient, a waste of space. For us, however, “busy” is a curse word.

The question is: what are we focused on?” There is a vast difference between being busy and being focused. The former involves the typical tropes of productivity—anything to keep our hands moving, to keep going, to keep the conveyer belt in motion. It is no coincidence we refer to mundane tasks as “busywork.” Busywork works well for factories, robots, and fascism, but not so great for anyone who’s attempting to do something worthwhile with their waking hours. Being focused, on the other hand, involves attention, awareness, and intentionality. Today is Friday—the weekend is upon us.

So we let them sit in the attic, the cupboard, the garage. Then, during a weekend of inspiration, we decided to throw a #ScanningParty (if you put “party” at the end of anything, @RyanNicodemus will show up). First, we found a high-quality scanner we could rapidly feed photos and immediately save to a memory card, which we could then use in a few high-res digital picture frames so we could actually display our important photos. Plus, if anything were to happen to our homes—flood, fire, robbery—all those photos are saved and secured online; thus, we’ll never worry about losing those memories. Of course, the memories aren’t in our material possessions, but we discovered a well-curated photo collection triggers all the wonderful memories of yesteryear—without all the physical baggage. Next, to make the “party” a little more fun—and less lonely—we invited a few friends over, ordered food and drinks, and together we thumbed through the photographs of our childhoods in all its double-chinned grandeur, scanning our favorites to display.

We often hold on to things just in case we need them. We don’t let go because we might need something in some far-off, nonexistent, hypothetical future. We pack too much stuff in the remotest chance we might need something for trips and vacations. But we needn’t hold on to these things just in case: we rarely use our just-in-case items—they sit there, take up space, get in the way, weigh us down. Most of the time they aren’t items we need at all. Instead, if we remove the just-in-case items from our lives, we get them out of the way and free up the space they consume. Over the last few years, the two of us let go of the vast majority of our just-in-case possessions. And during our last book tour, we made sure we didn’t pack anything just in case. Then we tested our hypothesis, which we call the 20/20 Rule: anything we get rid of that we truly need, we can replace for less than $20 in less than 20 minutes from our current location. Thus far, this hypothesis has become a theory that has held true 100% of the time. Although we’ve rarely had to replace a just-in-case item (fewer than five times for the two of us combined), we’ve never had to pay more than $20 or go more than 20 minutes out of our way to replace the item. This theory likely works 99% of the time for 99% of all items and 99% of all people—including you. More important, we haven’t missed the hundreds of just-in-case items we’ve gotten rid of, and we didn’t need to replace most of them. Getting rid of these items clears our minds, frees up our space, and takes the weight off our shoulders.

Over the last few years, the two of us let go of the vast majority of our just-in-case possessions. And during our last book tour, we made sure we didn’t pack anything just in case. Then we tested our hypothesis, which we call the 20/20 Rule: anything we get rid of that we truly need, we can replace for less than $20 in less than 20 minutes from our current location. Thus far, this hypothesis has become a theory that has held true 100% of the time. Although we’ve rarely had to replace a just-in-case item (fewer than five times for the two of us combined), we’ve never had to pay more than $20 or go more than 20 minutes out of our way to replace the item. This theory likely works 99% of the time for 99% of all items and 99% of all people—including you. More important, we haven’t missed the hundreds of just-in-case items we’ve gotten rid of, and we didn’t need to replace most of them. Getting rid of these items clears our minds, frees up our space, and takes the weight off our shoulders. What are you holding on to just in case?</a></p>

As a follow-up to yesterday\'s technology tip, it\'s important to remember that digital clutter actually isn\'t as troublesome as physical clutter. For example: Have you ever tried to carry a thousand books up a flight of stairs? How about a dozen photo albums? Or maybe a library of DVDs? If you have, then you know it\'s much easier to move those possessions when they\'re digital: a thousand books fit easily onto an e-reader; photo albums display nicely in digital frames; and nearly every movie ever made streams effortlessly from the cloud. That said, digital clutter can still be problematic. You see, unlike the physical world, you\'ll never be able to eliminate digital clutter completely, so it\'s best to organize our digital world to make it easier to navigate. Just think of the Internet as an example: the World Wide Web is infinite, and thus impossible to &quot;declutter.&quot; It is, however, organized with precision (URLs, IP addresses, etc.). We can do something similar with our personal computers, smartphones, and other devices. Here\'s a tip: once a month, organize the folders on your computer, delete excess photos on your phones, clear unused bookmarks from your web browsers, and archive any files you haven\'t accessed in the past 30 days. With a backed-up archive, you\'ll have searchable access to all your files should you need them, but they\'ll be out of the way until you do. Personally, we save everything to @Dropbox, and then once a month we move unused files and folders into an &quot;Archive&quot; folder.

I had to purchase a new pair of bluejeans recently—and I paid Full Price. My previous pair, tattered after two years of literal wear and tear, were beyond repair. You see, I avoid Sale Price whenever I can, and opt instead to pay Full Price: even though I don’t spend a lot of money overall, I tend to purchase higher quality items—not for their brand names, but because I’m willing to pay more for things that look good, work well, and last long. Because I’m responsible with money, the higher priced, higher quality items actually cost less over time. The reason I avoid Sale Price, though, has less to do with quality or money, and more to do with my impulses.

I had to purchase a new pair of bluejeans recently—and I paid Full Price. My previous pair, tattered after two years of literal wear and tear, were beyond repair. You see, I avoid Sale Price whenever I can, and opt instead to pay Full Price: even though I don’t spend a lot of money overall, I tend to purchase higher quality items—not for their brand names, but because I’m willing to pay more for things that look good, work well, and last long. Because I’m responsible with money, the higher priced, higher quality items actually cost less over time.

Experiences worth considering: concert tickets, a home-cooked meal, tickets to a play or musical, breakfast in bed, a back rub, a foot rub, a full-body massage, a holiday parade, walking or driving somewhere without a plan, spending an evening talking with no distractions, making-out under the mistletoe, visiting a festival of lights, cutting down a Christmas tree, watching a sunrise, skiing, snowboarding, sledding, dancing, taking your children to a petting zoo, making snow angels, making a batch of hot apple cider, taking a vacation together, watching a wintertime sunset.

We started The Minimalists five years ago with the hope that we could contribute to the greater good. Because of the power of sharing, our website has grown to more than 4 million readers—and hundreds of thousands of people subscribe via email and follow our inspirational messages on Twitter and Facebook and this newfangled thing called Instagram. We’re grateful for every person who reads our content, finds worth in our words, and shares our message. We appreciate you; we want you here. We don’t, however, want anyone to feel obligated to stick around if they don’t continue to find value in our work. We understand that our message will not resonate with everyone. So if you stop finding value in our message, please feel free to unsubscribe or unfollow. You won’t hurt our feelings. Scout\'s honor. We’d rather you spend your time and attention on something that adds value to your life. We want you to be happy, and so the last thing we want to do is add to the clutter. This rule shouldn’t apply only to The Minimalists, though: we must be willing to unfollow anyone; and when someone unfollows us, we must be willing to let go. No one needs to be offended when someone unfriends them on Facebook or stops following them on Instagram. But unfortunately, many people feel hurt, disrespected, or disregarded when someone leaves their online social circle. Instead of feeling offended—instead of questioning the other person’s intentions—we need to realize that we can’t add value to everyone all the time, and that even though someone found value in us previously, that doesn’t mean they will necessarily find value now or in the future. People often grow in different directions; that’s the beauty of life. It\'s okay to move on. That said, if you do find merit in our words, please continue to share our essays via email and social media. Help us spread the word. We appreciate the love. Thank you for being part of a movement that is bigger than any one (or two) person(s).']);" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">#MinimalsmTips Day 30: Declutter your social media feeds: unfollow any account that doesn&#39;t add value to your life.

This may be our last day of the month, which means it\'s the last day of our daily #MinimalsmTips, but that doesn\'t mean we\'ve reached our endpoint. Minimalism itself is not a destination; it is a path toward a more meaningful life. Once we\'ve simplified, we must continue questioning everything, from our material possessions and our careers, to our relationships and our daily activities. A new month is right around the corner, and so if you\'d like to keep your momentum, this is the perfect time to play our 30-Day Minimalism Game. Here\'s how it works: find a friend or coworker, and agree to donate or sell some of your excess possessions over the next month. On day one, get rid of one item each. Day two, two items. Day three, three items. So forth and so on. Whoever goes the longest wins. If you both make it to the end of the month, you both win, because you have jettisoned nearly 500 items that no longer clutter your life. Share your progress with thousands of other people using the #MinsGame hashtag. A simple life is a well-curated life.
